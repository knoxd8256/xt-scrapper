          Who is this Extraterrestrial Gardener, and what is he growing?
        </h2>
        <p class="block">
          John has been noodling colors onto, well, everything since he was a
          small child. His fascination with color and texture, nature and
          technology, the smallest flower and the far reaches of space have all
          led him here, to the Garden!
        </p>
        <h2 class="subtitle">The mission at hand.</h2>
        <p class="block">
          Our aim is to spread that art far and wide, and bring a bit of joy to
          everyone. Few things are as purely positive as the
          <strong>"Awesome Tee!"</strong>
          interaction we've all had, whether we are seeing it or wearing it, and
          that is what the Extraterrestrial Gardener is all about!
        </p>
        <h2 class="subtitle">No gardener works alone.</h2>
        <p class="block">
          John's artistic design work and attention to detail is the heart of
          our little family run venture. David, Agile Webmaster, keeps all our
          info flowing; Quartermaster Joe pulls shirts and inks into the studio
          and sends your wearable art to you in tiptop time; and our Chief of
          Staff Mel makes sure everybody eats and sleeps sometime...
